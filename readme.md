## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this portfolio from scratch. All CSS JS and HTML. A few CSS animations and JS functions for mobility.

## Optimizations
Plan to further build out projectst and apps.

## Lessons Learned:

Starting from scratch can be quite challanging. However, it is easier to understand what is going on in your code.

<!-- ## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
